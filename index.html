			<h1><span class='anon-redacted'><span>Lex Bailey</span></span>'s CV</h1>
			<p>Hi, I'm <span class='anon-redacted'><span>Lex</span></span>, and my pronouns are <span class='anon-redacted'><span>they/them</span></span>. Formal Verification is my thing. I'm looking for a job where I can apply formal methods, or develop new techniques and processes for formal verification.</p>
            <p>I'm interested in both software and hardware verification. </p>
            <p>I'm approaching the end of my PhD at the University of York and I am looking to move from accademia back in to industry.</p>

                    <p>I'm currently in the final year of my PhD research in the Department of Computer Science at <span class='anon-inst-redacted'><span>the University of York</span></span>. I'm working on a method for formally verifying confidentiality properties in computer programs or computer hardware. As part of this work I have developed a proof-of-concept workflow for verifying Rust programs.</p>

					<p>I joined <span class='anon-inst-redacted'><span>Arm Research</span></span> full time in 2019. I started as a Research Engineer and was later promoted to Senior Research Engineer. I also had four internships at <span class='anon-inst-redacted'><span>Arm</span></span> during my undergraduate study.</p>
					<p>In total I spent four years at <span class='anon-inst-redacted'><span>Arm</span></span>, in which time I developed...
						<ul>
							<li>Formal verification tooling for parts of <span class='anon-inst-redacted'><span>Arm</span></span>'s CPU architectures.</li>
							<li>A fuzzing tool for random testing of security related architecture.</li>
							<li>A cycle accurate model of an architecture in-development for performance analysis. This has since been released as 'Helium' <a href='https://www.arm.com/why-arm/technologies/helium' ><span class='anon-inst-invisible'>https://www.arm.com/why-arm/technologies/helium/</span><span class='anon-inst-visible'>[link text contains company name, redacted]</span></a></li>

					<p>I graduated from <span class='anon-inst-redacted'><span>the University of York</span></span> with a first-class degree in Computer Science in 2019. I started the degree in 2016.</p>
					<p>My final-year project was in the areas of machine learning and natural language processing. I developed and compared a few methods for extracting time expressions from English-language prose.

					<p>I started studying Electronic Engineering with Nanotechnology at <span class='anon-inst-redacted'><span>the University of York</span></span> in 2013, but after my internship in the summer of 2014, and my experience with the second year of the course. I decided that I would rather study Computer Science. I left this course after two years (in 2015), saved enough money during an internship to be able to start a CS degree, and moved to the CS department at the same university in 2016.</p>
